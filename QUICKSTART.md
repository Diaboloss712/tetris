## üéÆ How to Play Multiplayer

### Local Network (Same WiFi) - FREE

1. **Host** starts the server (Step 2 above)
2. **Host** finds their IP:
   - Windows: Open CMD and type `ipconfig`
   - Mac/Linux: Open Terminal and type `ifconfig`
   - Look for IPv4 address (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

3. **All players** (including host) run:
   ```bash
   cd client
   python lobby.py ws://HOST-IP:8000
   ```
   Replace `HOST-IP` with the actual IP address

4. **In the Lobby**:
   - One player clicks "Create Room"
   - Others click "Join Room" and select the room
   - All players click "Ready"
   - Game starts automatically when everyone is ready!

### Internet Play (Play from Anywhere) - Uses ngrok (FREE)

1. **Host** downloads [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download)

2. **Host** starts the server:
   ```bash
   cd server
   uvicorn main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   ```

3. **Host** opens a NEW terminal and runs:
   ```bash
   ngrok http 8000
   ```
   
4. **Host** copies the URL shown (e.g., `https://abc123.ngrok.io`)

5. **All players** (including host) run:
   ```bash
   cd client
   python lobby.py wss://abc123.ngrok.io
   ```
   (Use the ngrok URL from step 4)

6. Follow the lobby steps above to create/join rooms!
